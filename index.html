<!--            <p class="lead my-3"> Since December 2019, the world has been fighting against Covid-19.-->
<!--                We will look at the Covid-19 daily new case numbers along with total vaccinated rate,-->
<!--                so that we can answer the question- if Covid-19 vaccinated rate correlate with new case numbers.-->
<!--                <br> The data is filtered from December 2020 because the vaccines were distributed around that time <br>-->
<!--                I suggest you to take a look at the 3 countries(USA, Israel, UK) that was outstanding at one point of the Covid-19 journey.-->
<!--                At the end of the scenes, you will have chance to explore other countries data as well. </p>-->

                <p class="lead my-3"> Early July, New York Times released an article revealing Covid-19 cases are growing even with the increase of vaccinations.
                    While reading the article, I was curious to see if this was happening in any other countries as well.
                    <br> To answer the question; if Covid-19 daily confirmed cases are rising regardless of the increased pace of vaccinations, we will need to look at Covid-19 daily new case numbers along with the total vaccinated rate by country.
                    I suggest you to take a look at the 3 countries(USA, Israel, UK) that was outstanding at one point during the Covid-19 pandemic.
                    The U.S. being the first country to have 1 million people infected, Israel which was the first to have 50 percent of the population vaccinated,
                    and the UK which was the first country to authorise and begin use of the Pfizerâ€“BioNTech vaccine in a mass vaccination program.
                    <br> At the end, you will have chance to explore the data of other countries.
